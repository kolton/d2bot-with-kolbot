You may input stat types as an integer, or as string type defined as below.
Make sure string types are defined in lowercase.

0, "strength", "str", "s"
1, "energy", "enr", "e"
2, "dexterity", "dex", "d"
3, "vitality", "vit", "v"


Example:

Config.AutoStat.Build = [
	["strength", 35], // spend points in strength until it reaches 35 strength (all +stats from items are ingnored!)
	["vitality", 50], // spend points in vitality until it reaches 50.
	["dexterity", "block"], // spend points in dexterity until it reaches desired block chance defined in Config.AutoStat.BlockChance (+dexterity items are taken into account for "block" option)
							// when more stat points are available after leveling, AutoStat will go through the array again and it will continue to stat dexterity as needed.
							// if paladin has holy shield skill available and if it's not active, it'll attemp to cast holy shield first
	["strength", 55], // spend points on strength until it reaches 55
	["vitality", "all"] // all remaining points will be spent in vitality.
];


If you are allocating stats points for high level character and you know your strength/dex requirements,
you may simply specify strength and dexterity value to what you want and put rest into vitality

Config.AutoStat.Build = [
	["strength", 55], // spend points in strength until it reaches 35
	["dexterity", 150], // spend points in dexterity until it reaches 150
	["vitality", "all"] // spend all remaining points in vitality
];


If you are building a character from scratch along with AutoBuild system, you want to be more specific about order of stat allocation.

Config.AutoStat.Build = [
	["strength", 12], // stat strength for quilt armor
	["vitality", 28], // spend in vitality until it reaches 28 (level 5)
	["energy", 50], // spend in energy until 50 (level 8)
	["vitality", 50], // spend more in vitality
	["strength", 15], // get up to 15 strength (level 13)
	["vitality", 65], // spend in vitality (level 18)
	["strength", 35], // get up to 25 strength (level 20)
	["energy", 75], // spend in energy (level 25)
	["v", 75], // level 27
	["s", 55], // level 31
	["v", 100], // level 36
	["s", 80], // level 41
	["v", 125], // level 46
	["s", 95], // level 49 (less if done stat quests)
	["v", "all"], // put rest of the points in vitality
];
