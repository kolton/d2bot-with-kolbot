# D2BS with HotFixes and extended functionality 

## What is this?
This is a fork of the (in)famous D2Bot with Kolbot. It is based on the latest release of Kolbot as of 07/2019.
I've added some personal scripting and fixed some issues with the major version of this software.


## HotFixes
- fixed a Bug in D2BotMuleLogging, which made it impossible to log multiple accounts with char "all" setting
- fixed a Bug, which caused D2BotMuleLogging to log first mule in account twice (GER) on char "all" setting


## What's to come?
This Fork will be for "semi-legit" Bot-using and scripting as for everyday needs like:
- muling from one account to another
- getting mule logs
- making an UI for proper overview of multiple accounts
- muling in Browser-UI (qequed and executed by bot)
- Profile for "Mule-Keeping"
- advanced human behaviour 
- more scripts to run
